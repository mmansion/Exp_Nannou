# Exp_Nannou

This is my creative coding sketchbook using Nannou. I'm making the repository public in order to share my explorations with the community. 

Sketches you'll find here are experimental. I make no claim that anything actually works! Feel free to poke around and you find something useful give a shout!

Nannou is a library that aims to make it easy for artists to express themselves with simple, fast, reliable code. If you're unfamiliar with Nannou, learn about more about it [here](https://nannou.cc/) and consider joining the community.
